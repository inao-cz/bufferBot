    <h5>Welcome to this documentation.<br/>Please, keep in mind that this documentation is still in progress and can get
        updated over time. :)</h5>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>Basic info</h5>
        <p>This project is meant as a Discord bot base, based on Javacord in language Java. Right now, base is running
            on Java 8.</p>
        <p>Some of powerful features:</p>
        <ul class="collection white-text">
            <li class="collection-item grey darken-4">Empowering Reflections to create autoloading of classes</li>
            <li class="collection-item grey darken-4">Possibility to use SQLite for data saving. Meaning you don't have to run own
                database server.
            </li>
            <li class="collection-item grey darken-4">Usage of Log4j2 library. Logging both into Discord channel itself and file. This
                can be fully configured in code
            </li>
            <li class="collection-item grey darken-4">Empowering Project Lombok. So any Getters and Setters in code are history here,
                we are doing it using annotations
            </li>
            <li class="collection-item grey darken-4">Own communication server to connect ANY API on bot side. For example, connect
                Discord with Minecraft to create sync between permissions, chat messages and more
            </li>
            <li class="collection-item grey darken-4">Extensible config trough Google GSON library</li>
            <li class="collection-item grey darken-4">Strong cryptography using BouncyCastle library</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Project is using maven as dependency management and building tool. pom.xml provided has already been configured to provide you build with all libs needed, so-called FatJar.</p>
        <p>To build this project with all of your changes, just execute task <code class="black-text">install</code>. When this task is executed successfully, go to the directory target. There should be file <code class="black-text">inaosBot-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>. This is your file.</p>

<!-- Configuration -->
<div class="container" id="config">
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>Configuration</h5>
        <p>Configuration in this project is done trough JSON format. Google GSON is being used to load config files.</p>
        <p>There are two files.</p>
        <p>One of them is <code class="black-text">config.local.json</code> and this file is meant
            for local development purposes. File is being ignored by default in <code
                    class="black-text">.gitignore</code></p>
        <p>Second is <code class="black-text">config.json</code>. This file is meant as production
            file. FILE IS NOT IN .gitignore!</p>
        <p>Config data itself is being held in memory as object <code
                class="black-text">Config</code> so please keep in mind, any changes done to the JSON
            file has to be reflected in this object too</p>
        <h5>Some IFs</h5>
        <p>If file <code class="black-text">config.local.json</code> is present, any values are taken
            from this file and <code class="black-text">config.json</code> is ignored. This is to
            provide maximum comfort to the developer</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Autoload -->
<div class="container" id="cmd_autoload">
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>Autoloading</h5>
        <p>As mentioned in introduction, this base uses Reflections to create autoloading. But even this really comfy
            feature has some rules.</p>
        <p>But first, how this works? If some certain condition is met, autoloader will try to load a class and create a
            new instance of it. This happens only on bot load, after that a map of these elements is held in memory.</p>
        <p>This at first doesn't sound like a good idea, but it's actually really comfy for the developer, and I think
            it's even better in preventing errors or forgetting something.</p>
        <p>Autoloading is able to handle Commands, EventListeners and Command Parameters</p>
        <p>Please remember Permission annotation, this will get handy later on.</p>
        <h5>Some IFs</h5>
        <p>Command loading happens only in package <code class="black-text">me.inao.discordbot.command</code>
            but package can be changed in class <code class="black-text">Main.java#L58</code>. Command has to be tagged by appropriate interface <code class="black-text">ICommand.java</code></p>
        <p>EventsListeners loading happens only in package <code class="black-text">me.inao.discordbot.event</code>
            but package can be changed in class <code class="black-text">Main.java#L56</code>. EventListener has to be tagged by appropriate interface <code class="black-text">IListener.java</code></p>
        <p>Do I have to write it down for CommandParameters as well? It's exactly the same.</p>
        <p>Modifying constructors for one class will most probably render it not loadable and throw an exception.</p>
        <h5>Code examples</h5>
        <p>Basic structure of command class. Note that this is the required minimum for it to even load.</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">package me.inao.discordbot.command;

import me.inao.discordbot.Main;
import me.inao.discordbot.ifaces.ICommand;
import me.inao.discordbot.ifaces.IParameter;
import org.javacord.api.entity.message.Message;

import java.util.List;

public class About implements ICommand {
    @Override
    public void onCommand(Main instance, Message message, List&lt;IParameter> args) {

    }

    @Override
    public Class<? extends IParameter>[] requiredParameters() {
        return new Class[0];
    }
}</code>
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Annotations -->
<div class="container" id="annotations">
    <h5>Annotations</h5>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>Right now, there are two custom annotations. ParameterType and Permissions. While ParameterType is not used in the wild yet, Permission is pretty useful already. Let's talk about these.</p>
    <p><span class="blue-text lighten-1">ParameterType</span> is for command parameters. In default command mode (Own command parser and executor), this annotation is useless. But when the new command system (Slash commands) is used, this Annotation is used to tell Discord what type of data should be provided as parameters.</p>
    <p><span class="blue-text lighten-1">Permission</span> annotations in really useful right now. This permission will set default permission bitmask value for command. If a command class contains this annotation and command <span class="red-text">IS NOT CONFIGURED IN CONFIG</span> (Config has higher powers here and if command has configured permission in config.json, permissions will be overridden by config), permissions will be checked on try to execute.</p>
